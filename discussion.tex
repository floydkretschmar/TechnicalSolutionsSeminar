In this section you can summarize and link your assigned reading. Try to distill an overall insight 
from the papers, not to make a laundry list of individual results. Did you come across open questions 
that were not answered in the papers? Are there hidden pitfalls or problems that, in your opinion, the 
papers do not solve or marginalize? Provide a critical but constructive reading without being dismissive. 
Ideally, try to do some literature research of your own to find follow-on papers or related works.
