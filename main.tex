\title{The Societal Challenge: \\ Legal Perspectives on Discrimination}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This report gives a basic introduction to fairness with regards to machine learning. 
  We will summarize a multitude of existing works in the field and discuss their findings
  as well as their implications. The discussed papers and articles describe why the issue
  of fairness is a fundamental challenge for the field of machine learning, as it is based
  on learning form data. This is followed up by a discussion about a generalized mathematical 
  framework, by which the fairness of machine learning algorithms can be quantified and judged. 
  Furthermore the impact of machine learning in the specific area of criminal risk assessment 
  and automated decision making is evaluated. Especially the relationship between machine 
  learning systems and existing laws and judicial processes is examined. This report ends 
  with a discussion of the future impact these systems will have on judicial processes as 
  well as society at large. We present a set of short and long term challenges to be 
  addressed by both the machine learning community as well as overall society with 
  regards of the fair use of machine learning.
