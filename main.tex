\title{The Societal Challenge: \\ Legal Perspectives on Discrimination}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  This template provides guidance on the structure for your 4 page report. Please feel free to deviate from the proposed structure if you feel that it is useful; but try to follow the spirit of the guidelines.
  In the abstract, summarize the topic of your report in about 5-8 lines of text. Do not cite your assigned papers here, but instead give a very concise overview over the insights you report on in this text.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

In this section, provide a brief overview of both the general topic of your assigned work (i.e.~Fairness, Privacy, Explainability or, in one case, uses of ML for sustainability). Then introduce your assigned reading and put it into the context of the overall topic. Use proper citations, like this one \cite{Berk.2018}. See below for more information about the Bibliography.

\section{Relevant Work}

Here you should discuss your assigned works individually (if you have been assigned to read several chapters in a textbook, make separate subsections for each chapter).

\subsection{Fairness and machine learning: Limitations and Opportunities}

Discuss your first assigned paper \cite{barocas-hardt-narayanan}. Outline the main idea and key results. If suitable, reproduce key mathematical insights. Ideally, also provide critical comments of your own were suitable. But make sure to clearly delineate the ideas and experiments in the assigned paper from your personal opinion or analysis.

\subsection{Fairness in Criminal Justice Risk Assessments: The State of the Art}

Discuss your second assigned paper \cite{Berk.2018}. Outline the main idea and key results. If suitable, reproduce key mathematical insights. Ideally, also provide critical comments of your own were suitable. But make sure to clearly delineate the ideas and experiments in the assigned paper from your personal opinion or analysis.

\subsection{Big Data’s Disparate Impact}

Discuss your third assigned paper \cite{Barocas.2016}. Outline the main idea and key results. If suitable, reproduce key mathematical insights. Ideally, also provide critical comments of your own were suitable. But make sure to clearly delineate the ideas and experiments in the assigned paper from your personal opinion or analysis.

\subsection{Machine Bias}

Discuss your forth assigned paper. Outline the main idea and key results. If suitable, reproduce key mathematical insights. Ideally, also provide critical comments of your own were suitable. But make sure to clearly delineate the ideas and experiments in the assigned paper from your personal opinion or analysis.

\section{Discussion}

In this section you can summarize and link your assigned reading. Try to distill an overall insight from the papers, not to make a laundry list of individual results. Did you come across open questions that were not answered in the papers? Are there hidden pitfalls or problems that, in your opinion, the papers do not solve or marginalize? Provide a critical but constructive reading without being dismissive. Ideally, try to do some literature research of your own to find follow-on papers or related works. 

\section{Summary}

Provide a concise summary of your findings, in about 3-10 lines of text.

\section{Appendix: Possible Additions}
Here we can provide all relevant additional information.
