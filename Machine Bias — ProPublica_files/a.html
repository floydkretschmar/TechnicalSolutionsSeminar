So just how many Black & Brown [& even working class white] folks, do NOT have some financial 'issues' from time to time- in such a currently depressed economy???\n\nThey even use where one lives against Blacks [sections: Resident Stability & Social Environment {= if you live in a Hi Crime Area]- IMO that should only be relevant if you\u2019ve actually have a prior felony conviction, especially for committing a felony in that &/or nearby &/or similar type neighborhood.\n\nThe whole section on Leisure- about how bored one \u2018feels\u2019 is IMO of dubious relevance.\n\nThe Criminal Personality section is IMO most 'ironic'- Because IMO if the average Poly-trician &/or Wall St Bankster [& even cop too] took it, they'd FAIL miserably- 'IF' they'd ever even answer truthfully!!! \n\nOther ironic questions ask about 'Feeling the need to be armed to be safe in your own neighborhood- Ironic considering that it's FOX Noise / 'Good Ole Boy' type White Guys who're the most heavily armed & vocal NRA / 2nd Amendment / SYG / concealed & open-carry hard-core staunch-proponents in the entire US!!!\n \n'I won't hesitate to threaten & even hurt someone who's hurt my family &/or friends' - Quite ironic in this post 9-11 GWOT era, where we've got the Top Repug POTUS candidates openly calling for killing off 'alleged' Islamic 'terrorists' entire families in retaliation, & Dim Billary's bloody track-record in Iraq, Libya, Syria & she's threatened to 'Obliterate Iran' if it attacks Israel [w non-existent nukes]!!!  \n\nThen there's the last question: 'Some folks don't deserve respect & should be treated just like animals'- Quite ironic since that would seem to be exactly the attitude of the US' racially biased criminalized injustice system re: so many Blacks- especially those who are / have been in prison!!","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"4848657870","forum":"propublica","depth":2,"points":3,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":true,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2016-05-30T21:03:58","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":8,"message":"\u003cp>Wow.

 'predictive law-enforcement' for you:  investigate every single cop on 
the force and every single taxpayer making more than $500k a year.  
You'll find crime there with no problem, no problem at all.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-24" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">24</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18i1ai1"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2690805097"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-2690981761"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2690981761"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/poor_richard2/" data-action="profile" data-username="poor_richard2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="35849008" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/poor_richard2/" data-action="profile" data-username="poor_richard2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor_richard2</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690805097" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Lars Carlson</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690981761" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 6:00 PM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>The

 so-called 'unbiased' [Oh really?] Assessment report, as a computer 
based 'predictor' of the likelihood that an offender may offend again, 
asks 137 questions- which IMO could / should be cut-down to just 1/2 or 
even 1/3 of that. A number of questions are thinly disguised racially 
biased, &amp; many are quite redundant [IE: it asks about gang 
affiliation at-least 3 or 4 different Xs]. In fact many or most [or even
 all] of some entire sections are questionable at best: IE: Under Family
 Criminality: Asks if you were raised by both parents or NOT, or if 
you're adopted or raised in foster care [obviously this is biased vs 
Black people], then if your parents &amp;/or even siblings were ever 
arrested, &amp; then asks again if they were ever convicted [= 
redundant].</p><p>Then there's the sections on Work / Hire-ability, 
&amp; Education- obviously since Blacks' unemployment rate has for 
decades been 2Xs that of whites, this is biased vs Blacks. Then it even 
asks even if you do work, does your [lack of] Education &amp; Skills set
 only allow you to at-best get minimum wage jobs- Huhh WTF!! Damn! Talk 
about a Black guy can't win for losing!! <br>- Then there's a section 
asking if you've got financial problems. So just how many Black &amp; 
Brown [&amp; even working class white] folks, do NOT have some financial
 'issues' from time to time- in such a currently depressed economy???</p><p>They
 even use where one lives against Blacks [sections: Resident Stability 
&amp; Social Environment {= if you live in a Hi Crime Area]- IMO that 
should only be relevant if you’ve actually have a prior felony 
conviction, especially for committing a felony in that &amp;/or nearby 
&amp;/or similar type neighborhood.</p><p>The whole section on Leisure- about how bored one ‘feels’ is IMO of dubious relevance.</p><p>The
 Criminal Personality section is IMO most 'ironic'- Because IMO if the 
average Poly-trician &amp;/or Wall St Bankster [&amp; even cop too] took
 it, they'd FAIL miserably- 'IF' they'd ever even answer truthfully!!!</p><p>Other
 ironic questions ask about 'Feeling the need to be armed to be safe in 
your own neighborhood- Ironic considering that it's FOX Noise / 'Good 
Ole Boy' type White Guys who're the most heavily armed &amp; vocal NRA /
 2nd Amendment / SYG / concealed &amp; open-carry hard-core 
staunch-proponents in the entire US!!!</p><p>'I won't hesitate to 
threaten &amp; even hurt someone who's hurt my family &amp;/or friends' -
 Quite ironic in this post 9-11 GWOT era, where we've got the Top Repug 
POTUS candidates openly calling for killing off 'alleged' Islamic 
'terrorists' entire families in retaliation, &amp; Dim Billary's bloody 
track-record in Iraq, Libya, Syria &amp; she's threatened to 'Obliterate
 Iran' if it attacks Israel [w non-existent nukes]!!!</p><p>Then there's
 the last question: 'Some folks don't deserve respect &amp; should be 
treated just like animals'- Quite ironic since that would seem to be 
exactly the attitude of the US' racially biased criminalized injustice 
system re: so many Blacks- especially those who are / have been in 
prison!!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-3" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">3</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18lc8ea"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2696354434"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2696354434-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2691112136-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper "><a class="show-children" id="post-2690805097-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2691528084"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2691528084"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/barfcom/" data-action="profile" data-username="barfcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="80156970" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/barfcom/" data-action="profile" data-username="barfcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry</a></span> </span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2691528084" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 11:03 PM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Wow.

 have been working as a statistician for 10 years, which is relevant 
when I say that predictive models are always wrong.  They are even more 
wrong when it comes to predicting human behavior.</p><p>Surprisingly, 
this model seems to be doing pretty well on an overall level. 70% for a 
consumer model would be amazing. The problem is, this isn't a consumer 
model, this is a model that is impacting the lives of individuals.  And 
it is wrong, analysts know it is going to be wrong some percentage of 
the time.</p><p>I have some general ideas how the strong racial bias 
could have happened from a modeling perspective. Often there are hidden 
relationships in the data that are difficult to see, which is why the 
concept of "Correlation does not imply Causation" is so critical to all 
modeling endeavors. <br>For instance the percentage of the black 
population with family members in prison is higher than the non black 
population. It is likely that race SHOULD have been considered in order 
to control for the pre exsisting racial bias in our current system. 
There are many other possible reasons for the model to behave this way.</p><p>But
 the reasons behind this racial bias are not the point. This is a model 
that the modelers should never have built, in my opinion. Or at the very
 least it should never have been deployed this way. Handing a simplistic
 analysis like this off to non analysts without a very strong sense of 
it's error and overall limitations is just a set up for failure.</p><p>Some times the question is not "Can we predict this?"

 you actually look at the questionnaire on which this {non}'Predictive' 
{mis}'Analysis' is based, you'll see it's quite redundant as well as 
biased [IE: asks about gang affiliation at-least 3Xs - 4Xs]. It has 
whole sections where IMO much/most if not ALL the questions are of 
dubious relevance [IE: one section asks mainly about boredom]. IMO the 
sections asking about family ties [were / are you raised in a 2 Parent 
home], employment &amp; education status, &amp; if one lives in a 
hi-crime area- are all [blatantly] Biased against Black people [= 
'clever' ways of 'determining' if someone's most likely Black without 
actually asking the question outright].</p><p>Thus IMO this

 enough, if ProPublica have done their stats homework correctly here 
(and that is an if - it's not easy), then what they've found is evidence
 of this. If the profiling software doesn't look explicitly at race, but
 returns predictions that are disfavorable to blacks - well, another way
 of saying the same thing is that their test shows blacks do better than
 their circumstances suggest. So if they included race as an explicit 
factor in their model, not only would it be more predictive, it would be
 better for blacks as well...</p><p>There are some big ifs about that, 
though. Frankly, I have my doubts. Also, even if this happy result holds
 up for this particular variable (race), I think that we should oppose 
it on general principle. You should not be judged for those of your 
characteristics you obviously have no power over.</p><p>The correct 
approach is to make the models so that they are actively blinded to the 
protected characteristics - so that if you look at the variables, your 
guess about the subject's race or gender would be no better than random.

simplistic by today's standards (and probably their own time's).</p><p>And
 yes, predictive accuracy might suffer - but that's the price we pay for
 equality.

 obvious problem in general is that any system like this can only work 
on the data that is collected and the data that is collected comes from 
arrests and convictions, but if minorities are more likely to come to 
the attention of law enforcement, i.e. more likely to be arrested than 
whites per incident of law breaking, and more likely to be convicted 
than whites, then the models are going to pick up on that and of course 
be biased against minorities.</p><p>This is an obvious case of building a model on a biased sample, and thus getting biased results, which are self-reinforcing.</p><p>The
 problem with models like this is that the outcomes are not truly 
independent of the model. Models like this are used in insurance, and 
that's a lot less problematic, because in insurance it is the INSURED to
 files the claim that the models predict.</p><p>But with this type of 
model, it is the POLICE who take the action that is being predicted. So 
the police see the prediction, and then the police have a level of 
control over the outcome (at both an individual and sample level), 
whereas insurance companies don't have control over the outcome.</p><p>This is bad, bad, practice.</p><p>The problem here is that there is no good way to get truly unbiased data.</p><p>Hypothetically, let's use the following assumptions (totally made up numbers on my part):</p><p>Only 1 out of 20 incidents of breaking the law committed by whites results in an interaction with law enforcement.</p><p>1 our of 10  incidents of breaking the law committed by blacks results in an interaction with law enforcement.</p><p>When
 there is an interaction with law enforcement, for whites 1 out of 5 
results in an arrest. For blacks 1 out of 3 results in an arrest.</p><p>When there is an arrest, for whites 1 out of 4 results in a conviction. For blacks 1 out of 2 results in a conviction.</p><p>I don't know what the real numbers are, but I suspect that the patter I've laid out above is somewhat close to the real world.</p><p>What a computer model REALLY needs to predict is the chance that a person will "break the law" in the future.</p><p>But
 of course, if most of the time that whites break the law they are never
 caught and prosecuted, then the computer model has no real knowledge of
 how often they break the law. The computer can only know about arrests 
and convictions. But if the system is biased against blacks in terms of 
arrest and conviction rates per law breaking incident, then of course 
the computer models will be too.</p><p>I think anyone would have to be a
 total fool not to acknowledge that middle-class and wealthy whites 
break the laws at far higher rates than poor people and minorities, per 
conviction.</p><p>In other words, for middle-class and wealthy whites, 
they probably break the law 50 to 100 times per conviction. In other 
words, out of every 100 times that they break the law, an actual 
conviction happens. But for poor blacks its probably more like 1 out of 
every 15 or 20 times. So blacks are being convicted at a MUCH higher 
rate per actual violation than whites, and of course this will heavily 
biases any computer model against blacks and just perpetuate the 
problem, as this article states.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-9" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">9</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-1" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18i1bqk"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2690806700"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-2691241662"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2691241662"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/shinobi42/" data-action="profile" data-username="shinobi42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="1707811" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/shinobi42/" data-action="profile" data-username="shinobi42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shinobi42</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690806700" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> R.

 disagree.  Violent and other serious crimes happens at *much* higher 
rates in black communities, particularly if you're comparing actually 
poor black communities to actually affluent white communities (but even 
otherwise).  I say this based on actual victim survey data (not just 
arrests, convictions, etc), crime reports, body counts, unreported 
gunshots in urban neighborhoods, etc.  There are very strong 
correlations between neighborhood demographics and these crime stats 
(even adjusting for income &amp; poverty rates).  There might be some 
truth to your point of view with some petty crimes, like smoking weed, 
where increased police activity and limited alternatives in urban areas

 typically rely on these sorts of tools to manage their caseload, and 
given the prevailing view that black people who've been arrested are 
guilty and dangerous, I'm hardly surprised that this profiling reveals 
that.</p><p>In the case of the girls that rode on the scooters, let's 
look at this as an example of overcharging--burglary and petty theft?  
What happened to "a stern talking to and don't ever do that again?"  
When I was a kid, I took some lipstick from Woolworth's and was caught 
by a store manager. He took me to his office and gave me some tough 
talk, then called my grandma to come get me.  Kids do these things, and 
to lock up kids who act out is really unnecessary.</p><p>My question is 
this:  does one have to take this psychological examination if arrested?
  I realize how the police would threaten you if you refused to take it,
 but if you are black, there is no good reason to take it knowing that 
it would go against you anyway.  You have a right not to give evidence 
against yourself--claim the 5th amendment.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-2" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">2</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18i7h9f"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2691093795"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2691093795-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2690765107"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2690765107"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/mitt_zombie/" data-action="profile" data-username="mitt_zombie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="120813098" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/mitt_zombie/" data-action="profile" data-username="mitt_zombie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitt Zombie</a></span> </span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690765107" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 3:48 PM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>90%

 they don't. In fact, studies show that upper-class whites commit the 
most actual crimes in America per-capita. In terms of drug use alone, 
the highest rate of actual illegal drug use in America is among 
upper-class whites, and they have almost no fear at all of ever being 
arrested for it.</p><p>Drug use is higher in general among whites than 
blacks, in part because blacks know that they are far more likely to get
 in trouble for it. Whites have very little fear of law enforcement, so 
drug laws have almost no deterrent impact at all on white behavior 
regarding illegal drugs.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-6" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">6</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/18i3zjg"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2690930860"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2690930860-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2690875754"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2690875754"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/ronaldbrucerobinson/" data-action="profile" data-username="ronaldbrucerobinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="93041589" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/ronaldbrucerobinson/" data-action="profile" data-username="ronaldbrucerobinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronald Bruce Robinson</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690824985" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Guest</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2690875754" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, May 23, 2016 4:59 PM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Racist
 enforcement of laws AND laws that target black populations go all the 
way back to the 19th Century's "Black codes." Black people have been 
criminalized ever since, and therefore overwhelmingly overpopulated in 
the baseline figures used to make statistical analyses of crime. This 
then creates a feedback loop where Black people are increasingly 
targeted, arrested, and imprisoned. In other words, it becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophesy that enables racist whites to blame Black 
people and hide their racism behind statistics.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

 meandering and poorly thought out article. The COMPAS tool like others 
is attempting to evaluate the same facts that judges and prosecutors use
 when deciding whether to take someone to trial, deciding on sentencing 
and for parole. The old standard -- human assessment -- is far from 
perfect, and prone to bias. The computer algorithms are seeking to 
improve on them. They are certainly far from perfect too. So the 
question is, are they better than the judges and prosecutors? Has that 
been studied?</p><p>Whether are not the algorithm rates a certain race 
higher is a red herring. What is important, racially, is only if their 
accuracy is better or worse for certain races. If it is, then figure out
 why, and either fix the algorithm or throw it out completely and go 
back to human gestalt.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/19m2kxj"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:2758049911"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-2758049911-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-2749491766"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="2749491766"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/dbr1/" data-action="profile" data-username="dbr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="6373545" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/dbr1/" data-action="profile" data-username="dbr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbr1</a></span> </span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing#comment-2749491766" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Saturday, June 25, 2016 5:21 AM">3 years ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Does

 It seems ironic that a measure of hardship in childhood, like whether 
your parent was sent to prison, would be used to increase punishment for
 someone, when having a hard childhood would be more likely to lead to a
 reduced sentence, if it were instead described in court.</p><p>2. If
