\begin{frame}{Machine Learning and fairness: Key questions}
    Fundamental questions at the core of fairness discussion in Machine Learning:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why is fairness in Machine Learning an \textbf{immediately pressing issue}?
        \item Is \textbf{Machine Learning inherently susceptible to unfairness} and why?
        \item What is \textbf{the legal definition of fairness} and how does this perspective inform our view of fairness in Machine Learning?
        \item How can we \textbf{formalize fairness in a mathematical way}?
    \end{itemize}
